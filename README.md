# Baseline-Prediction-of-Chinese-Potential-Forest-Carbon-Sinks-under-Future-Climate-Scenarios
The annual forest biomass increment was converted by GEDI, and the future carbon sequestration potential of existing forests in China was evaluated using the corrected future climate, forest age, and topographic variables.
The two Downscaling files are tas and pr downscaling processing code and need to be run in Ubuntu+cdo+python+jupyter. Data_corr is the variable correlation analysis code, and RF_ABI is the ABI estimation code using Rondom Forest as an example. They need to run in R.
